# Logistic Regression Classification 

## Overview
This repository contains a Machine Learning classification  implemented in **Python**.  
The project demonstrates the complete workflow of a supervised learning problem using **Logistic Regression**, including cost function, gradient descent, model training, evaluation, and handling overfitting.

The goal of this project is to understand how classification algorithms work internally rather than only using ready-made libraries.
